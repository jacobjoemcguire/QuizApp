# recipe-quiz

I created a personality quiz that tells you which recipe you are based on the answers you give, these are a selection of Guosto customer favourites. I am currently learning javascript so this project has taken longer than expected to complete.

## Development
This project was created using javascript as the backend aswell as Html and CSS to display the page. This project is being developed in VScode using the Live server extension.
